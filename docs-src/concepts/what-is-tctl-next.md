This documentation reflects the "next" version of Temporal's tctl command line tool.
`tctl next` was formerly known as [tctl v2.0.0-beta](https://github.com/temporalio/tctl#trying-out-new-tctl-v200-beta-with-updated-ux).

:::note

Update to version 1.17 or later before switching to `tctl next`.

The Temporal CLI (tctl) is a command-line tool that you can use to interact with a Temporal Cluster.
It can perform [Namespace](/concepts/what-is-a-namespace) operations (such as register, update, and describe) and [Workflow](/concepts/what-is-a-workflow) operations (such as start
Workflow, show Workflow History, and Signal Workflow).
