When [replaying](/dev-guide/typescript/testing#replay) Workflow Executions, you can set breakpoints in your Workflow code. If you're using VS Code, you can use the [Temporal VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=temporal-technologies.temporalio) to easily load Event Histories and set breakpoints on Events. For usage, see the [announcement post](https://temporal.io/blog/temporal-for-vs-code) or [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IjQde9HMNY).
