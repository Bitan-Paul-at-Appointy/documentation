A Default Build ID is the specific Build ID that a Worker refers to when executing Tasks.
While this is typically the most recent Build ID, you can manually specify a different Build ID as the default when registering the Workflow with a Worker.
This option is beneficial for situations where you prefer an older Build ID to be the default rather than the latest one.
A unique Default Build ID can be assigned to both the Task Queue and each individual Compatible Version Set.

If you have one Build ID, it's known as the Default Build ID.
