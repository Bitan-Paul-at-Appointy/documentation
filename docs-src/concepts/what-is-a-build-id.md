A Build ID is any string that you associate with a version of a Workflow. As a user-generated string, it is used to track, manage, and reference different stages or versions of the Workflow.

In the context of a Workflow with Version Sets, a Build ID can be assigned as the default for a Version Set or as the overall default for the entire Workflow.

A Build ID can contain a maximum of 255 characters.
